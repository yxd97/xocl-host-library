# Frequently Used APIs of Xilinx OpenCL

## Introduction
Xilinx OpenCL (XOCL) is a runtime library developed by Xilinx (now AMD).
It provides a set of OpenCL-compatiable APIs for programming with AMD FPGAs.

Compared to Xilinx Runtime (XRT), XOCL runs at a higher level of abstruction.
Programmers using XOCL no longer need to think about register mappings and
control protocols.

This manual aims to provide a quick reference for the most basic and frequently used APIs.
