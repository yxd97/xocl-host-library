## Method to reproduce the data

To reproduce the data, you need to `source setup.sh`

then, get into the example folder. The `pagerank-xhl-module` and `spmv-xhl-module2device`
are not complete yet. 

You can choose any example and get into the folder, then run `make check`. 

There are three option `sw_emu hw_emu hw`. If you want to change the mode,

you can directly change the `TARGET` value in `common.mk`. 

Then, if you can run `make exe`, then `make kernel`.

To launch the process, you need to `XCL_EMULATION_MODE=$mode ./host $KERNEL_NAME.xclbin (PATH_TO_DATASET)`

`$mode` means sw_emu, hw_emu, and hw. `$KERNEL_NAME` means the name of the kernel, the xclbin file should be generated by `make kernel`. If you are running the spmv kernel, you need to add the path to dataset.
